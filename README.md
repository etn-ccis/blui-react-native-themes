This package provides [theming](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/style/themes) support for Eaton applications using the Brightlayer UI design system. It includes resources for developers using React Native with [react-native-paper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-paper). This package comes with two theme options: a Blue theme (standard) and a Dark theme.

For other frameworks, check out our related packages:

-   [@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/angular-themes)
-   [@brightlayer-ui/react-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-themes)

## Installation

Install with npm

```shell
npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes
```

or yarn

```shell
yarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes
```

# Usage

> **NOTE:** Using the Brightlayer UI React Native theme requires that you add the Open Sans font to your application. You can learn how to do this by reading the instructions for [Vanilla React Native](https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-custom-fonts-ccc9aacf9e5e) or [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-custom-fonts/). This will be added automatically if you start your project with the [@brightlayer-ui/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).

> When using Expo, you will need to specify the name for each font weight you load using the format `OpenSans-<Weight>`, e.g., OpenSans-SemiBold. Refer to one of our React Native demos for reference.

To use our themes in your application, simply wrap the app in a `Provider` and pass in your desired theme (e.g., `blue`, `blueDark`).

#### Light Theme

```tsx
import { Provider as ThemeProvider} from 'react-native-paper';
import * as BLUIThemes from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes';
...
// Default Theme
<ThemeProvider theme={BLUIThemes.blue}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### Dark Theme

```tsx
import { Provider as ThemeProvider} from 'react-native-paper';
import * as BLUIThemes from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes';
...
<ThemeProvider theme={BLUIThemes.blueDark}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```


### React Native Paper Components Style Override

This Document contains a set of style overrides in components around various [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/index.html) components.

By default, the theming mechanism provided by RNP is very minimal and does not allow us to style components precisely the way we want for Brightlayer UI applications. The theme does not cover all cases to circumvent this issue, for some components, you may need to add extra styles or theme overrides inline that can be used to bring them in alignment with Brightlayer UI applications

To style components listed in the document to look correct in the application, you should use the [Brightlayer UI Components Style Override](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-themes/blob/master/RNPComponents/RNPComponents.md) in place of the respective components from React Native Paper.

### TypeScript

Our Brightlayer UI themes extend the themes provided by React Native Paper. If you are using these themes in a TypeScript project and want to access any of the properties that were added to the defaults, you need to use useExtendedTheme hook in your project:

```tsx
import { useExtendedTheme } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes';
...
const theme = useExtendedTheme();
<Button mode="contained" style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.onOrangeFilledContainer }}>
    Label
</Button>
```

### Upgrading from version 6 -> 7

In the version 7, the library has been updated to use [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) v5, which is adopting [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/). The themes have now been updated to use Material Design 3 Themes.
